# Heart_Diseases-Prediction
This project aims to apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to a health-related dataset to draw insights and build predictive models. You will analyse factors that contribute to heart disease and create a model that predicts the presence of heart disease in individuals based on their health metrics.

You will use the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which contains records of patients with varyingdegrees of heart disease. The dataset can be found at [UCI Machine Learning Repository:Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

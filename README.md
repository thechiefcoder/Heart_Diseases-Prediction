# Heart_Diseases-Prediction
This project aims to apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to a health-related dataset to draw insights and build predictive models. You will analyse factors that contribute to heart disease and create a model that predicts the presence of heart disease in individuals based on their health metrics.
